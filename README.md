# CS110: Algorithms and Data Structures 

This is a repo for the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course at Minerva (we call it "Computation: Solving
Problems with Algorithms". Syllabus is available in this repo). 

* **Topics**: Sorting algorithms (mergersort, insertion sort, bubble sort, selection sort, quicksort, heapsort), heaps and priority queues, time and space complexity analysis, randomization, hash tables and hash functions, binary search trees, red-black trees, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms. 

* My final project is about *finding the cheapest flight problem*, using 3 *graph algorithms (Bellman-Ford, Floyd Warshall, Dijkstra's algorithm)*.
